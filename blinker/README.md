# Blink LED Project

The LED Blink demo is breaks down an FPGA project to its very basics.  The demos contains a counter which is incremented and drives an LED.  This project gives the user an idea of how things are working within the FPGA and acts as a "Hello World" applicaton on the FPGA.

## Description

This is a "hello world" demo for the LOGI FPGA written in **Verilog**. The generated bitstream should be loaded using the *logi_loader* and the FPGA begins to run: the two LED should turn on and off, counting from 0 to 3 over and over again.

## Instruction

Add the files to a new project in Xilinx ISE.
